            <h3>communication is key</h3>
            <p>For most, gym climbing is seen as the end of the road—but in reality it’s just the beginning. While indoor facilities provide a safe and convenient environment in which to practice, climbing can be most enjoyed in the great outdoors—where variables such as weather, rock, and scenery are constantly changing.</p>
            <p>When issuing commands, always start by calling your partner’s name. Oftentimes at busy crags, many parties will be climbing and issuing similar commands to your own. By calling your partner’s name at the beginning, you can clarify the direction for your communication. Always acknowledge received commands with a “thank you!” followed by your partner’s name.</p>
